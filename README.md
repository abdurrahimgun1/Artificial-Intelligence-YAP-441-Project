Sokoban is a puzzle game where a warehouse operator must push boxes to designated target points. The aim of this project is to apply and evaluate various search algorithms for solving the Sokoban game. The study comparatively examines classical and modern search methods such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, A*, and iterative deepening A*. The effectiveness of each method has been assessed in terms of solution time, memory usage, and the optimality of the found solution. Additionally, the unique challenges of Sokoban, especially the potential for boxes to block each other and the complexity of the sequence in reaching targets, have been analyzed in detail regarding their impact on the performance of search algorithms. The results obtained in the project suggest the most suitable search strategies for specific types of puzzles and highlight the potential of search algorithms in solving NP-hard problems like Sokoban.
